Normally, food passes from the mouth into the esophagus, and then into the stomach. The stomach serves as a reservoir for food, to allow you to eat a big Thanksgiving. The stomach starts digestion, and then after the meal slowly allows small portions of food to pass into the small intestines, where most of the digestion occurs.

There are two types of feeding tubes:

Jejunostomy tubes are placed in the small intestine

Gastrostomy tubes are placed in the stomach

Your dietitian and physician will help you decide which tube is best for your situation

:::

## Gastrostomy Tube

Feeding Gastrostomy

- Feeding with a syringe several times per day.
- Tube can be hidden underneath clothing
- Tube does not interfere with eating by mouth
- Removed easily in the office when no longer needed


## Gastrostomy Tube Methods

A gastrostomy tube can be placed either by endoscopy, which is called a PEG tube

A gastrostomy tube can also be placed by laparoscopy, which is usually preferred if surgery on the esophagus is planned in the future.

Your surgeon will help you decide which kind of tube is best for you. This is especially important if you will need esophageal surgery in the future, as the stomach is frequently used to make a new esophagus

## Gastrostomy Tube

-   Outpatient Placement (go home the same day)
-   Central venous port can be placed at the same time (if needed)

## Jejunostomy tube

The other type of feeding tube is a jejunostomy.

A jejunostomy tube tube is placed into the small intestines. Because the small intestine is used to receiving food in small quantities, a jejunostomy tube requires the use of a pump to deliver feedings gradually over a matter of hours.

In general, feedings are done at night in order to allow you to be active during the day
