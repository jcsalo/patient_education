## Anatomy

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 95%;"}
Food moves from the throat

$\rightarrow$ esophagus

$\rightarrow$ stomach

$\rightarrow$ small bowel (jejunum)

:::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines
:::

## Types of Esophageal Cancer

There are two common types of esophageal cancer

-   Adenocarcinoma
-   Squamous Cell Carcinoma

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
In many ways, these two different types of esophageal cancer behave in similar fashion.

We will see later that the treatment **can** be different depending upon whether the cancer is adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.
:::

## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upon the cancer stage**

## Esophageal Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

\
\

-   **T** = Tumor - Depth of growth into the wall of the esophagus\
    \
-   **N** = Nodes - Spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **M** = Metastasis - Spread to liver, lungs, or bone

## Layers of the Wall of the Esophagus

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If we look at the walls of the esophagus, we see several layers:
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mucosa - Inner layer\
    \
-   Muscle wall (muscularis)\
    \
-   Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor1_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## Early Stage Cancers

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Early-stage cancers are those that are small and have not grown very far into the wall of the esophagus.
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor21_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## Locally-advanced Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor24_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Locally-advanced cancers are those that have grown through the wall of the esophagus.
:::

## Lymph Nodes

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor25b_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If the lymph nodes contain enough cancer cells, they can be seen on CT scans or PET scans
:::

## T Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as the T stage
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t_full.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
T1 tumors are early stage, and T4 tumors more advanced
:::

## N Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **N1** cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t3_nodes_labels.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## M Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some cancers spread from the esophagus to other parts of the body

-   **M0** cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
-   **N1** cancers have spread lungs, liver, or bone
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_M_Stage.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## PET scan

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to light up areas of cancer.
:::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/PetImage.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
In some cases, the PET scan is not performed until a CT scans bas been done.
:::

## Endoscopic Ultrasound

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Similar to upper endoscopy (EGD)
-   Ultrasound probe in scope
-   Evaluates T stage of cancer
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/EUSArtboard.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Endoscopic ultrasound is most helpful in early stage cancers.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdomen
-   Areas of spread can be very small (grain of rice)
-   Laparoscopy can detect spread inside the abdomen
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_Laparoscopy.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Not all patients with esophageal cancer need a laparoscopy.

In general, laparoscopy is considered for cancers that invade from the esophagus into the stomach.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

-   Several incisions 1/4" long
-   A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.
-   Biopsies can be performed.

## Treatment Plan

\
\
- Superficial (T1) $\Rightarrow$ Endoscopic Therapy\
\
- Localized (T1b/T2) $\Rightarrow$ Surgery\
\
- Locally-advanced (T3/N1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemo $\pm$ Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery\
\
- Metastatic (M1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemotherapy

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.
:::

## Locally-advanced cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer often have localized spread of cancer cells in the surrounding area

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

Researchers studied 363 patients with esophageal cancer

Patients were treated in two groups:

\

**Surgery Alone**

vs

**Chemotherapy + Radiation** $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

Chemotherapy and radiation were given together over six weeks\
\
\

**Surgery Alone**

vs

**Chemotherapy + Radiation** $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\Rightarrow$ Longer Survival

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
The results were quite dramatic: The group that was treated with all three therapies, chemotherapy and radiation and surgery, lived on average twice a long as patients who had surgery alone.
:::

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

Typical schedule for chemotherapy + radiation:

-   Chemotherapy once per week for six weeks
-   Radiation five days per week for six weeks (28 treatments)
-   PET scan (or CT) 4 weeks after the end of radiation
-   Surgery 8 weeks after the end of radiation

## Chemotherapy + Radiation - Side Effects

Kills cancer cells in the esophagus and lymph nodes

Can also cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus.

Swallowing can be difficult the last two weeks of therapy.

Feeding tube may be needed for hydration and nutrition.

## Locally-advanced Adenocarcinoma

"Sandwich" chemotherapy given before and after surgery:

Chemotherapy (8 weeks) $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemotherapy (8 weeks)

Two different drug combinations:

-   FLOT (more effective)
-   FOLFOX (better tolerated)

## "Sandwich" Chemotherapy Drugs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**FLOT**

-   5-FU
-   Leucovorion
-   Oxaliplatin
-   Taxotere
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**FOLFOX**

-   5-FU
-   Leucovorin
-   Oxaliplatin
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Chemo + Radiation**

-   Chemo + Radiation (6 weeks)
-   Surgery
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Chemotherapy**

-   Chemotherapy (8 weeks)
-   Surgery
-   Chemotherapy (8 weeks)
:::
:::::

## Adenocarcinoma Treatment Options

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**CROSS Chemo + Radiation**

-   Longer track record (14 years)
-   Better tolerated
-   Port usually placed
-   Eating gets worse $\rightarrow$ better
-   May need feeding tube
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**FLOT Chemotherapy**

-   More effective than CROSS
-   More side effects
-   Port always required
-   Eating gets slowly better
-   Less likely to need feeding tube
:::
:::::

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously.

There are several options for intravenous access:

-   Peripheral IVs in the hand
-   PICC line (Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter)
-   Central Venous Port


{{< include lci_cvport.qmd >}}

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

\
\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy
