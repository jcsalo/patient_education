## Types of Esophageal Cancer

\

There are two common types of esophageal cancer

-   Adenocarcinoma
-   Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upont the cancer stage**

## Esophageal Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

-   **T** = Tumor - How deep has cancer grown into the wall of the esophagus?
-   **N** = Nodes - Has cancer spread to the lymph nodes?
-   **M** = Metastasis - Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body? lungs or liver?

## Lyaers of the Wall of the Esophagus

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mucosa - Inner layer
-   Muscle Wall (muscularis)
-   Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle

## Early Stage Cancers

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa

## Lymph Nodes

::::: columns

In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes

## T Stage

::::: columns

:::
:::::

## N Stage

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes

-   **N1** cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.

## PET scan

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to light up areas of cancer.

## Laparoscopy

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdominal cavity. These areas of spread can be very small, as small as a grain of rice.

In order to detect spread within the abdominal cavity, a proceduce called a laparoscopy can be performed in some some patients.

## Laparoscopy

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

-   Several incisions 1/4" long

-   A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.

-   Biopsies can be performed.

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

Over 10 years ago, researchers in the Netherlands took 363 patients with esophageal cancer and divided them into two groups. The two groups were treated differently:\

**Surgery Alone**

vs

\*\*Chemotherapy + Radiation $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

The results were quite dramatic: The group that was treated with all three therapies, chemotherapy and radiation and surgery, lived on average twice a long as patients who had surgery alone.

**Chemotherapy + Radiation** $\rightarrow$Surgery $\Rightarrow$ Longer Survival

Chemotherapy and radiation were given together over six weeks

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

A typical schedule for chemotherapy + radiation:

-   Chemotherapy once per week for six weeks
-   Radiation five days per week for six weeks (28 treatments)
-   PET scan (or CT) 4 weeks after the end of radiation
-   Surgery 8 weeks after the end of radiation

## Chemotherapy + Radiation - Side Effects

Radiation kills cancer cells, but can also cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus.

This can make swallowing more challenging the last two weeks of therapy.

A feeding tube is sometimes needed to help with hydration and nutrition.

## Locally-advanced Adenocarcinoma

For patients with *adenocarcinoma* another option is "sandwich" chemotherapy administered before and after surgery:

\

Chemotherapy (8 weeks) $\rightarrow$ Surgery Chemotherapy (8 weeks)

\

Two different drug combinations can be used:

-   FLOT
-   FOLFOX

## "Sandwich" Chemotherapy Drugs

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously.

There are several options for intravenous access:

-   Peripheral IVs in the hand
-   PICC line (Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter)
-   Central Venous Port

## Peripheral IVs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some patients can be treated with an intravenous line placed in the hand or arm for each dose of chemotherapy. The catheter is placed at the beginning of each dose and removed that day.

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

Surgery is typically performed 4-8 weeks after therapy, once recovered
