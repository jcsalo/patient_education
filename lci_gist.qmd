## GI Stromal Tumors

-   Arise from the wall of the stomach
-   Grow slowly over time
-   Lymph nodes rarely involved
-   Not conventional stomach cancer

## GIST vs Adenocarcinoma

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**GIST**

-   Starts from wall of stomach
-   Slow growing
-   Rarely spreads to lymph nodes
:::

## Benign or Malignant?

GIST tumors have a range of behavior:

-   Small tumors tend to behave in a benign manner but can grow over time
-   Larger tumors tend to behave in a malignant (cancerous) manner

## GIST Treatment

-   Initial treatment usually surgery
-   Risk of recurrence determined by pathology
  - Size of tumor
  - Mitotic rate = how rapidly tumor is dividing

## Imatinib = Gleevec

- Oral drug shrinks GIST tumors
- Well tolerated
- Given *after* surgery for high-risk tumors
  - 1 or 3 years depending upon risk
- Given *before* surgery for large tumors
