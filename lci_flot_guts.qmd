## Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is a form of cancer treatment that stimulates your immune system to fight cancer.

Some cancer cells will turn off immune cells using a protein called PD-L1. Immunotherapy can counteract this "off signal" and gives immune cells a "turn on signal" so that they fight cancer.

Darvalumab is an immunotherapy drug that fights cancers by counteracting PD-L1
