## Surgery for Esophageal Cancer

Surgery for esophageal cancer is performed in several situations:

-   Superficial Tumors (T1) not completely removed by endoscopy
-   Localized Tumors (T2N0)
-   Locally Advanced (T3) after preoperative therapy.

## Goals of Surgery

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Remove tumor from esophagus
-   Remove surrounding lymph nodes
-   Create a new esophagus

## Ivor Lewis (Transthoracic) Esophagectomy

::::: columns

- Removes tumor
- Removes lower 1/3 of esophagus
- Removes surrounding lymph nodes
- Reconstruction of GI tract

## Reconstruction

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A new esophagus is created from the stomach in the abdomen by fashioning it into a tube.

## Ivor Lewis esophagectomy

The new esophagus is now brought up into the chest. A new connection is made between the esophagus and the stomach, called an *anastomosis*.

## Minimally-invasive Ivor Lewis

-   Small incisions abdomen and chest

We have found this is the best option for most of our patients. In some cases, an open approach is still necessary.

## Total Esophagectomy

::::: columns

For patients with tumors in the upper esophagus, we need to remove more of the esophagus

## Total Esophagectomy

::::: columns

For those patients, we need to remove the whole esophagus, including the portion in the neck.

## Risks of Surgery

An esophagectomy is a substantial operation, and in some cases there can be postoperative complications. We're going to talk about two of these complications and what you can do to reduce your risk of complications:

-   Anastomotic leak
-   Pneumonia

## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The anastomosis is surgical connection between the esophagus and the stomach.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

:::

## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If anastomosis does not heal properly:

-   Leakage of fluid from the esophagus
-   Infection in the space between the lungs
-   Requires additional time in the hospital
:::

:::

## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If an anastomotic leak does occur:

-   Some leaks will seal on their own
-   A stent may be required to help healing
-   Occasionally additional surgey is required

## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Risk of a leak depends upon:

-   Type of operation performed
-   Overall nutritional status of patient
-   Experience of the surgeon

:::

## Pneumonia

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Pneumonia can occurs in about 10-15% of patients after esophagectomy.

Pneumonia requires treatment with antibiotics and frequently requires a longer hospitalization.

## Preventing Pneumonia

Several ways to help prevent pneumonia after surgery:

-   Deep breathing
-   Coughing
-   Walking

After surgery, this means:

-   Sitting in a chair most of the day
-   Walking in the halls as soon as possible
