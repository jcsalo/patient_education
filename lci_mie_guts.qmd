## Anesthesia

Epidural catheter usually placed for pain control

- Remains in place for 2-5 days
- Dosage can be adjusted as needed
- Can make it more difficult to urinate
- May require foley catheter in bladder
- Foley catheter removed after epidural removed


## ICU Stay

Multiple lines and tubes:

- NG tube in nose to drain stomach and esophagus
- Catheter in bladder
- Chest tube right chest
- Abdominal drains (usually 2)
- Feeding jejunostomy (usually says in 8 wks)

## Ward - 6Tower

- Jejunostomy feeding
- Up in a chair most of the day
- Walking in the halls
  - Start with assistance
  - Improves lung function
  - Prevents loss of muscle


## Jejunostomy Feeds

Jejunostomy tube feeds
- Start continuous (24 hours)
- Convert to night-time only (16 hours)

Water administered through feeding tube
- Usually 8oz 4 times/day
- Important to prevent dehydration

Diabetic patients may need insulin

## Jejunostomy Feeds with Diabetes

Jejunostomy feedings may cause blood sugars to be elevated
- Insulin may be required along with feeds

Typical Pattern for tube feeds
- Feeds run via pump from 6pm to 10am
- Insulin at 6pm (70/30 insulin)
- Insulin at Midnight (70/30 insulin)
- No insulin if tube feedings are not run

## Nasogastric (NG) Tube

Tube passed through nose into stomach
- Drains fluid from stomach
- Prevents vomiting

Upper GI X-ray on 2nd or 3rd day after surgery
- If stomach empties well $\rightarrow$ NG tube removed
- Otherwise, X-ray repeated 2-3 days later

## Swallowing Evaluation

Once NG tube has been removed:

Modified barium swallow in radiology

- 70% of patients $\Rightarrow$ liquids started by mouth


## Discharge

Goal: ready to leave day #6 after surgery

- Night-time tube feedings (6pm to 10am)
- Some nutrition by mouth (70% of patients)
  - 1 oz of water per hour by mouth  OR
  - Protein shakes 4oz every 2 hours in some 
- Water through tube 8oz four times per day
- Home care nursing (feeding tube teaching)
- Home infusion (tube feeding supplies)

## Medicines at Home - Pain

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 4000mg/day (1000mg 4 times/day)
Gabapentin 300mg 3 times/day (works best if taken every day)
Oxycodone
- Take as needed in addition to Tylenol and gabapentin
- Will begin reducing dosage at first postoperative visit
- Most patients can discontinue by 4 weeks after surgery
- NO DRIVING WHILE ON OXYCODONE
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (Celebrex)
- 200 mg every 12 hours starting 2 weeks after surgery
NO GOODY POWDERS OR BCs (Can cause permanent scarring at the surgery site)

## Medicines at Home - Acid Blockers

Acid blocker (Omeprazole, Nexium,etc)
- Will stay on for at 1-2 years to prevent acid reflux
- Important in preventing scarring at anastomosis (new connection between esophagus and stomach)
- To administer through feeding tube, open capsule and resuspend beads in 60mL (2oz) of water


## Medicines at Home

Reglan – Helps stomach empty
- Will plan to stop after six weeks
- 0.1% risk of tardive dyskinesia (nervous tic)
Remeron – Helps improve appetite
- Can cause vivid dreams
- Used for several weeks after surgery
- Will stop within first three months of surgery


## Medicines at Home - Beta Blockers

Metroprolol – Beta Blocker
- Slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure	
- Used around the time of surgery to prevent fast heart rhythms
- In patients who were not taking a beta blocker prior to surgery, will plan to wean over a few weeks after surgery
- For patients who were taking a beta blocker medicine prior to surgery, will return to prior dosage and drug after surgery

## Nutrition after Surgery

At discharge home: 
- Protein shakes 4oz every 2 hrs
- Tube feeds 4-5 cans at night (6pm-10am)
10-12 Days: Increase protein shakes
- Tube feeds 3-4 cans at night
Three weeks: Post-esophagectomy Diet
8-12 weeks: Remove feeding tube (in office)

## Transition from Tube Feeds $\rightarrow$ Eating

Dietitian will calculate daily protein goal
- Typically 60-75 grams protein/day
- Each carton of tube feeding has 15 grams
  - 75 grams protein = 5 cartons/night
- As protein intake by mouth increases, tube feeds can be reduced
Important that protein intake be spread out during the day (20gm/meal)
Three meals + 2-3 high-protein snacks

## Post-esophagectomy Diet

Soft Consistency
High Protein
Avoid sugary liquids (can cause ‘dumping’)
Avoid raw vegetables (and salads)
Eating
- Small, frequent meals
- Sit up for 30-45 minutes after eating
- Avoid eating within 2 hours of bedtime

## Wedge Pillow

Surgery to remove the esophageal tumor will lead to a tendency for reflux. The most helpful strategy is a 30 degree wedge pillow. This should be half as high as it is long.

## After surgery

Wean off medicines added after surgery
- Pain medicines
- Beta-blockers
