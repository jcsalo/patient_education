## Day Prior to Surgery

-   Clear liquids for 24 hours prior to surgery
-   Check with Pre-op nurse regarding medicines day prior to surgery
-   No tube feedings the night before surgery

## Day of Surgery

-   Arrive at 5am – nothing to eat or drink after midnight.
-   Medicines w/ a sip of water (or black coffee) but **no cream**.
-   Surgery will be cancelled if you have cream/milk
-   Waiting room for family and friends on 5th floor
-   Post-operative care in STICU (11th floor)

## Epidural Catheter for Pain Control

-   Remains in place for 2-5 days
-   Dosage can be adjusted as needed
-   Can make it more difficult to urinate
-   May require foley catheter in bladder
-   Foley catheter removed after epidural removed

## ICU Stay (2-4 days)

-   NG tube in nose to drain stomach and esophagus
-   Catheter in bladder
-   Chest tube right chest
-   Abdominal drains (usually 2)
-   Feeding jejunostomy (usually stays in 8 wks)

## ICU

-   Bladder catheter removed → check that bladder empties properly
-   Chest tube removed (day 2-4) → follow-up chest x-ray
-   Fluid emptied from drains every few hours
-   Start tube feedings by feeding
-   Feeding jejunostomy (stays in 8 weeks)

## Ward - 6Tower

-   Jejunostomy feeds started
-   Up in a chair most of the day
-   Walking in the halls
    -   Start with assistance
    -   Improves lung function
    -   Prevents loss of muscle strength

## Jejunostomy Feeds

Jejunostomy tube feeds

-   Start continuous (24 hours)
-   Convert to night-time only (16 hours)

Water administered through feeding tube

-   Usually 8oz 4 times/day
-   Important to prevent dehydration

{{< include lci_jejunostomy_guts.qmd >}}

## Activity

-   Up in chair most of the day
-   Walking with help from nurse/Physical Therapist
-   Goals:
    -   Improve lung function
    -   Prevent muscle loss

## Nasogastric (NG) Tube

Tube passed through nose into stomach

-   Drains fluid from stomach
-   Prevents vomiting

Upper GI X-ray on 2nd or 3rd day after surgery

-   If stomach empties well $\rightarrow$ NG tube removed
-   Otherwise, X-ray repeated 2-3 days later

## Swallowing Evaluation

Once NG tube has been removed:

Modified barium swallow in radiology

-   Drink a white chalky liquid (barium)
-   Look for proper swallowing function
-   70% of patients $\Rightarrow$ liquids started by mouth

## Protein Shakes

Most are taking protein shakes when they go home

Protein shakes are started after tolerating water\

-   2 oz per hour to start
-   4 oz per hour if 2oz are tolerated well

## Discharge

Goal: ready to leave day #6/7 after surgery

-   Night-time tube feedings (6pm to 10am)
-   Nutrition by mouth (70% of patients)
    -   1 oz of water per hour by mouth OR
    -   Protein shakes 4oz every 2 hours
-   Water through tube 8oz four times per day
-   Home care nursing (feeding tube teaching)
-   Home infusion (tube feeding supplies)

## Nutrition after Surgery

At discharge home:

-   Protein shakes 4oz every 2 hrs
-   Tube feeds 4-5 cans at night (6pm-10am)

10-12 Days: Increase protein shakes

-   Tube feeds 3-4 cans at night

Three weeks: Post-esophagectomy Diet

8-12 weeks: Remove feeding tube (in office)

## Transition from Tube Feeds $\rightarrow$ Eating

Dietitian will calculate daily protein goal

-   Typically 60-75 grams protein/day
-   Each carton of tube feeding has 15 grams
    -   75 grams protein = 5 cartons/night
-   As intake by mouth increases, tube feeds are reduced

Spread out protein during the day (20gm/meal)

-   Three meals + 2-3 high-protein snacks

## Post-esophagectomy Diet

-   Soft Consistency
-   High Protein
-   Avoid sugary liquids (can cause ‘dumping’)
-   Avoid raw vegetables (and salads)
-   Eating
    -   Small, frequent meals
    -   Sit up for 30-45 minutes after eating
    -   Avoid eating within 2 hours of bedtime

## Medicines at Home - Pain

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 1000mg 4x/day

Gabapentin 300mg 3 times/day

Oxycodone

-   As needed in addition to Tylenol/gabapentin
-   Will begin reducing dose at first postop visit
-   Can usually discontinue by 4 weeks
-   NO DRIVING WHILE ON OXYCODONE

## Non-steroidals Anti Inflammatory (NSAID)

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (Celebrex)

-   200 mg every 12 hours starting at 2 weeks

NO GOODY POWDERS OR BCs

-   (Can cause permanent scarring at the surgery site)

## Acid Blockers = Proton Pump Inhibitors

Examples include ompeprazole and pantoprazole

-   Will stay on for at 1-2 years to prevent acid reflux
-   Important in preventing scarring at anastomosis (new connection between esophagus and stomach)
-   To administer through feeding tube, open capsule and resuspend beads in 60mL (2oz) of water

## Medicines at Home

Reglan – Helps stomach empty

-   Will plan to stop after six weeks
-   0.1% risk of tardive dyskinesia (nervous tic)

Remeron – Helps improve appetite

-   Can cause vivid dreams
-   Used for several weeks after surgery
-   Will stop within first three months of surgery

## Metoprolol = Beta Blockers

-   Slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure\
-   Used to prevent rapid heart rate
-   Patients not taking a beta blocker prior to surgery $\rightarrow$ wean after after surgery
-   Patients taking a beta blockerprior to surgery $\rightarrow$ return to prior dose and drug after surgery

## Sleeping

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Reflux can occur the first few weeks/months after surgery

This improves over the first few months

A wedge pillow can be helpful for sleep

## Postoperative Visit

Check surgical site

-   Remove staples (if needed)

Adjust medicines as needed

-   Insulin (for diabetic patients on insulin)
-   Reduce beta blocker medicines

Advance diet

Reduce tube feeds

## After surgery

Wean off medicines added after surgery

-   Pain medicines
-   Beta-blockers
-   Reglan and Remeron

Continue acid blockers for at least 1 year

## Jejunostomy Removal

Jejunostomy tube is removed in the office once you can take in enough nutrients by mouth

Removal usually around 8 weeks after surgery

May take 30 minutes and some local anesthetic to loosen up the tube for removal.

## Nutritional Monitoring after Surgery

You may have difficulty absorbing some nutrients:

-   Iron
-   Vitamin B12
-   Vitamin D

## Nutritional Monitoring after Surgery

About 3 months after the jejunostomy tube is removed, we will check blood levels:

-   Iron (ferritin)
-   Vitamin B12
-   Vitamin D

## Nutritional Replacements after Surgery

Vitamin or iron replacements can be ordered by:

-   Primary Care Provider (PCP)
-   Medical Oncologist
-   Surgeon

If levels are low

-   Replacement
-   Repeat testing in 3-6 months
