## Anatomy

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 95%;"}
Food moves from the throat

$\rightarrow$ esophagus

$\rightarrow$ stomach

$\rightarrow$ small bowel (jejunum)

:::

:::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upont the cancer stage**

## Esophageal Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

\
\

-   **T** = Tumor - Depth of growth into the wall of the esophagus\
    \
-   **N** = Nodes - Spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **M** = Metastasis - Spread to liver, lungs, or bone

## Layers of the Wall of the Stomach

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If we look at the walls of the esophagus, we see several layers:
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mucosa - Inner layer\
    \
-   Muscle wall (muscularis)\
    \
-   Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor1_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## Early Stage Cancers

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Early-stage cancers are those that are small and have not grown very far into the wall of the stomach.
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}

:::
::::
::::::

## Locally-advanced Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor24_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Locally-advanced cancers are those that have grown through the wall of the stomach
:::

## Lymph Nodes

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor25b_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If the lymph nodes contain enough cancer cells, they can be seen on CT scans or PET scans
:::

## T Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as the T stage
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t_full.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
T1 tumors are early stage, and T4 tumors more advanced
:::

## N Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **N1** cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t3_nodes_labels.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## M Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some cancers spread from the esophagus to other parts of the body

-   **M0** cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
-   **N1** cancers have spread lungs, liver, or bone
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_M_Stage.png)
:::
::::
::::::

## PET scan

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to light up areas of cancer.
:::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/PetImage.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
In some cases, the PET scan is not performed until a CT scans bas been done.
:::

## Endoscopic Ultrasound

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Similar to upper endoscopy (EGD)
-   Ultrasound probe in scope
-   Evaluates T stage of cancer
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/EUSArtboard.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Endoscopic ultrasound is most helpful in early stage cancers.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdomen
-   Areas of spread can be very small (grain of rice)
-   Laparoscopy can detect spread inside the abdomen
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_Laparoscopy.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Not all patients with esophageal cancer need a laparoscopy.

In general, laparoscopy is considered for cancers that invade from the esophagus into the stomach.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

-   Several incisions 1/4" long
-   A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.
-   Biopsies can be performed.

## Treatment Plan

\
\
- Superficial (T1) $\Rightarrow$ Endoscopic Therapy\
\
- Localized (T1b/T2) $\Rightarrow$ Surgery\
\
- Locally-advanced (T3/N1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemo $\rightarrow$Surgery\
\
- Metastatic (M1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemotherapy

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with chemotherapy prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.
:::


## Locally-advanced Adenocarcinoma

"Sandwich" chemotherapy given before and after surgery:

Chemotherapy (8 weeks) $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemotherapy (8 weeks)

Two different drug combinations:

- FLOT (more effective)
- FOLFOX (better tolerated)
- ECF 

## "Sandwich" Chemotherapy Drugs

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
**FLOT**

-   5-FU
-   Leucovorion
-   Oxaliplatin
-   Taxotere
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**FOLFOX**

-   5-FU
-   Leucovorin
-   Oxaliplatin
:::
:::::

## Tumor Biomarkers

Surface proteins found on cancers which may show that additional drugs may be helpful:

- HER-2 $\rightarrow$ Herceptin can be helpful
- PD-L1  $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be helpful
- MMR  $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be helpful

The biomarkers are reported in a separate pathology report

Your medical oncologist will review these with you

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously.

There are several options for intravenous access:

-   Peripheral IVs in the hand
-   PICC line (Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter)
-   Central Venous Port

[Central Venous Port](lci_cvport.htm)

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

\
\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy
