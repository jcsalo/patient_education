We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Treatment Plan

\
Superficial (T1a): Endoscopic Therapy\
\
Localized (T1b/T2): Surgery\
\
Locally-advanced (T3M0): Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery\
\
Metastatic (M1): Chemotherapy

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone 
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 and M0 and are usually treated with chemotherapy prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Tumor Biomarkers - Additional Pathology Tests

Show whether other drugs may be helpful:

-   HER-2 $\rightarrow$ Herceptin can be helpful
-   PD-L1 $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be helpful
-   MMR $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be very helpful

Biomarkers reported in a separate pathology report

Your medical oncologist will review these with you

## Restaging

CT or PET scan performed after preoperative therapy

\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy
