## Chemotherapy Administration

Most chemotherapy is administered by vein. 

Several options exist to administer chemotherapy through veins:

- Intravenous catheter in peripheral veins
- Peripheral Intravenous Central Catheter (PICC)
- Central Venous port

## Peripheral IV catheter

A peripheral IV catheter involves placing a small tube into the veins, which is then used to give fluids or chemotherapy

A new catheter is placed for each dose of chemotherapy

## Intravenous Catheter in Peripheral Vein ("IV")

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

- IV catheter placed into a vein in the hand or arm
- Allows administration of chemotherapy and fluids
- Placed at the beginning of each dose
- Removed that day at the end of treatment
- Not suitable for FLOT chemotherapy

FLOT chemotherapy requires a home infusion pump, got which a peripheral IV won't work

## PICC Lines

- Placed in Radiology
- Stay in place during all of treatment
- Can stay in place for weeks
- Special care is needed at home to keep it clean and dry

## Central Venous Port

- Implantable device that makes the administration of chemotherapy easier

- No special care at home

A central venous port is an implantable device that makes the administration of chemotherapy easier.

Once it is in place, it requires no special care at home

With a port, you can shower, bathe, and swim without restriction

A central venous port is suitable for FLOT chemotherapy

A port can be used for blood draws for blood tests as well.

## Central Venous Port

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Placed underneath the skin below the right collarbone
- Incision in the neck (1/4")
- Incision below the collarbone
- Sutures dissolve on their own
- "Superglue" on incisions

A port is placed underneath the skin and usually below the right collarbone.

Two incisions are made for placement: a quarter-inch incision over the neck,
and a one-inch incision below the collarbone.

Sutures are under the skin and dissolve on their own

Surgical "Super Glue" covers the incisions and flakes off after a week or so

## Central Venous Port

When it is time for chemotherapy, a needle is inserted through the skin into the port

When it comes time for chemotherapy, the nurses can easily access the port with a needle that goes through the skin into the port, rather than placing an intravenous needle in a vein. The drugs can then be administered directly into the bloodstream. If blood needs to be drawn for tests, this can also be done through the port.
