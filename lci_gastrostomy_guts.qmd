There are two types of feeding tubes:

-   Jejunostomy tubes are placed in the small intestine

-   Gastrostomy tubes are placed in the stomach

Your dietitian and physician will help you decide which tube is best for your situation

## Gastrostomy Tube

Feeding Gastrostomy

-   Feeding with a syringe several times per day.
-   Tube can be hidden underneath clothing
-   Tube does not interfere with eating by mouth
-   Removed easily in the office when no longer needed

## Gastrostomy Tube Methods

PEG: Tube placed by endoscopy

Laparoscopic: Tube placed surgically by laparoscopy

Preferred method depends upon whether esophagectomy is planned

## Gastrostomy Tube

-   Outpatient Placement (go home the same day)
-   Central venous port can be placed at the same time (if needed)
