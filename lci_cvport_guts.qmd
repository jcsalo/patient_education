## Chemotherapy Administration

Most chemotherapy is administered by vein.

Several options exist to administer chemotherapy:

-   Intravenous catheter in peripheral veins
-   Peripheral Intravenous Central Catheter (PICC)
-   Central Venous port

## Intravenous Catheter in Peripheral Vein ("IV")

:::::: columns

-   IV catheter placed in vein of hand or arm
-   Allows administration of chemo and fluids
-   Placed for each dose
-   Removed that day
-   Not suitable for FLOT chemo

A peripheral IV catheter involves placing a small tube into the veins, which is then used to give fluids or chemotherapy

A new catheter is placed for each dose of chemotherapy

FLOT chemotherapy requires a home infusion pump, got which a peripheral IV won't work

-   Placed in Radiology

A PICC line is placed in Radiology and stays in place during the treatment course Special care is needed at home to keep the catheter and it's dressing clean and dry

## Central Venous Port

-   Implantable device makes chemo easier
-   May shower in 24 hrs
-   No special care at home
-   OK for FLOT chemo
-   Allows for blood draws

A central venous port is an implantable device that makes the administration of chemotherapy easier.

Once it is in place, it requires no special care at home

With a port, you can shower, bathe, and swim without restriction

A central venous port is suitable for FLOT chemotherapy

A port can be used for blood draws for blood tests as well.

## Central Venous Port

-   Implanted under skin
-   Neck incision (1/4")
-   Incision below the collarbone
-   Sutures dissolve
-   "Superglue" on incisions

A port is placed underneath the skin and usually below the right collarbone.

Two incisions are made for placement: a quarter-inch incision over the neck, and a one-inch incision below the collarbone.

Sutures are under the skin and dissolve on their own

Surgical "Super Glue" covers the incisions and flakes off after a week or so

## Central Venous Port

When it is time for chemotherapy, a needle is inserted through the skin into the port

When it comes time for chemotherapy, the nurses can easily access the port with a needle that goes through the skin into the port, rather than placing an intravenous needle in a vein. The drugs can then be administered directly into the bloodstream. If blood needs to be drawn for tests, this can also be done through the port.
