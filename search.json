    "text": "Anatomy\nThe esophagus is a hollow muscular tube which connects the throat to the stomach. Normally, the esophagus pushes food from the throat to the stomach. The food passes through a one-way valve called a sphincter between the esophagus and the stomach. The sphincter is a valve which prevents food and acid from going back up into the esophagus. Once food is in the stomach, acid is added to start digestion. The stomach then pumps food out through another one-way valve called the pylorus, to enter the duodenum and eventually the small intestines for digestion. The pylorus controls how much food enters the small intestines at one time, so that the small intestines don’t become overwhelmed by too much food at one time."
