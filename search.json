Acid in the stomach then starts the process of digesting food. A one-way muscular valve called the sphincter keeps acid in the stomach and prevents it from refluxing up into the esophagus.\nIn some cases, however, the sphincter doesn’t work properly and acid can splash up into the esophagus, which can cause symptoms of heartburn. In addition, the acid causes irritation to the lining of the esophagus called the mucosa. Over time, in response to the irritation, the esophagus changes the lining and it becomes more resistant to acid. In many cases, the symptoms go away but the acid reflux persists. The new lining that forms on the mucosa of the lower esophagus is called Barrett’s Esophagus"

    "text": "I’m Dr Jonathan Salo, a GI Cancer Surgeon at the Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nIf you’re viewing this video, chances are that you or someone close to you has encountered esophageal cancer and is contemplating treatment.\n\nFor a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.\nSo patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:\n\nA small group who don’t have any difficulty eating that have early stage disease\nMajority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have advanced disease.\n\n\nPatient with advanced esophageal cancer fit into two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic. Patients with advanced esophageal cancer usually have some difficulty eating, so nutrition becomes an important part of the treatment plan. We have a video on nutrition Link card\n\nLocally Advanced -&gt; T3M0\nMetastatic -&gt; M1\n\nFor more information about advanced esophageal cancer, there is a link above and in the description. Advanced Esophageal Cancer\n\nAmong those with early stage disease, there are two categories:\n\nSuperficial -&gt; Treated without surgery\nLocalized -&gt; Treated with surgery alone\n\n\nIf this terminology is not familiar to you, please refer to our video on Gastroesopahgeal Cancer Diagnosis and Staging. There is a link above and in the description below.\nEsophageal Cancer Diagnosis and Staging\n\n\n\nEarly Esopageal cancers are T1 or T2, and have no evidence of spread to the lymph nodes AND there is no sign of metastatic disease. They are therefore T1 N0 M0 or T2 N0 M0\n\n!!! Need graphic with T1 AND T2 tumors !!!\n\n\n\n\nPatients with early stage esophageal cancer usually don’t have any difficulty swallowing. Instead, most patients discover they have an early-stage cancer when they have reflux symptoms or bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to an upper endoscopy and a diagnosis.\n\n\n\nFor many patients, early stage esophageal cancer is a result of long-standing reflux, which causes Barrett’s esophagus.\nIn ordinary circumstances, food passes from the throat to the esophagus to the stomach. Acid in the stomach then starts the process of digesting food. A one-way muscular valve called the sphincter keeps acid in the stomach and prevents it from refluxing up into the esophagus.\nIn some cases, however, the sphincter doesn’t work properly and acid can splash up into the esophagus, which can cause symptoms of heartburn. In addition, the acid causes irritation to the lining of the esophagus called the mucosa. Over time, in response to the irritation, the esophagus changes the lining and it becomes more resistant to acid. In many cases, the symptoms go away but the acid reflux persists. The new lining that forms on the mucosa of the lower esophagus is called Barrett’s Esophagus\n\n\n\nOver time, the cells that make up Barrett’s Esophagus can begin to change and become more abnormal-looking under the microscope. This is termed dysplasia, and is important because dysplasia can in some cases lead to cancer.\n\n\n\nWith the passage of time, the Barrett’s Esophagus cells can acquire the ability to grow and ignore the normal signals that keep cells from growing. At this point, the cells have the ability to grow, and are called cancer or carcinoma cells.\n\n\n\nAt first, the cells are confined to the top layer called the mucosa. These are termed intramucosal cancers, or T1. The good news is that if they are detected early, they can often removed with endoscopy and don’t require surgery.\n\n\n\nOne technique which can allow the removal of a T1 cancer by endoscopy is called endoscopic mucosal resection. In this technique, a small amount of fluid is injected underneath the top layer, raising a sort of blister. This can then allow the tumor and a surrounding disk of tissue. The pathologist then examines the tissue to see whether all of the cancer cells have been removed.\n\n\n\nThe ideal situation is one in which the cancer cells are located in the middle of the tissue removed, a little like a sunny-side up fried egg. This is considered a “favorable” situation and in many cases patients need no further therapy, but just need careful follow up with with periodic upper endoscopy or EGD\n\n\n\nIn cases, the cancer cells are found at the edge or the bottom of the tissue removed, and this raises questions about whether there might be cancer cells left behind. This is considered and “unfavorable” situation. In some cases, the best approach is surgery, especially if there are cancer cells found at the bottom of the tissue removed. In other cases, careful follow up endoscopy is performed.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, an esophageal cancer is not discovered until it grows much deeper into the wall. Once it grows into the muscle, it is too deep to remove with the endoscope and surgery is required.\nIn most cases, an endoscopic ultrasound is needed to confirm the precise depth of the cancer.\nWe have a video on esophageal cancer surgery here Esophagectomy\nIf it grows all the way through the muscular wall, it is considered T3 and Locally Advanced. In these cases, it is best to becgin with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in order to shrink the tumor prior to surgery.\n\nI hope you have found this video helpful.

The stomach serves as a reservoir for food, to allow you to eat a big Thanksgiving. The stomach starts digestion, and then after the meal slowly allows small portions of food to pass into the small intestines, where most of the digestion occurs.\n\nFor patients with cancer of the esophagus or stomach, the most common feeding tube is a jejunostomy tube\n\nFor patients with cancer of the esophagus, there are two different kinds of feeding tube which can be used:\nA gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach\nA jejunostomy tube is placed in the small intestines\nYour dietitian and physician will help you decide which tube is best for your situation\n\nGastrostomy tube\n• Placed into stomach\nJejunostomy tube\n• Placed into small intestine\n\nFeeding Gastrostomy\nA gastrostomy tube allows feeding with a syringe, which can be done several times per day.\nWhen it’s not being used, the gastrostomy tube can be hidden underneath clothing.\nFor patient who later need surgery on the esophagus, it will be necessary to remove the\ngastrostomy tube and place a jejunostomy tube, as the stomach frequently used to create a new\nesophagus\n\nA gastrostomy tube can be placed either by endoscopy, which is called a PEG tube\nA gastrostomy tube can also be placed by laparoscopy, which is usually preferred if\nsurgery on the esophagus is planned in the future.\nYour surgeon will help you decide which kind of tube is best for you. This is especially important if you will need esophageal surgery in the future, as the stomach is frequently used to make a new esophagus\n\nA gastrostomy tube is generally placed as an outpatient, which means you can go home the same day.\nIn some cases, a central venous port for chemotherapy is placed at the same time as a gastrostomy tube.\n\nThe other type of feeding tube is a jejunostomy.\nA jejunostomy tube tube is placed into the small intestines. Because the small intestine is used to receiving food in small quantities, a jejunostomy tube requires the use of a pump to deliver feedings gradually over a matter of hours.\nIn general, feedings are done at night in order to allow you to be active during the day\n\nA jejunostomy tube is used in cases where it’s not possible to place a gastrostomy tube, such as when there is a tumor in the stomach. A jejunostomy tube is routinely used after esophageal surgery, so in patients who need help with nutrition prior to surgery, it makes sense to put in a jejunostomy tube before surgery. The same tube can then be used for nutrition both before and after surgery.\n\nWe have a link here to a video that explains more\nabout the jejunostomy tube\n\nI hope this video has been helpful.\nHere are links to other videos you may find helpful.\nFeel free to subscribe in order to be notified about new videos\nGastrostomy Jejunostomy"

Let’s take a look at the different team members:\n\nGastroenterologist works with an endoscope, which is a flexible tube which inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. The gastroenterologist may perform one of several procedures in your care:\n\nUpper endoscopy to examine the inside of the esophagus and stomach and biopsy any concerning areas\nEndoscopic ultrasound is used in some cases to carefully examine the depth of invasion of a tumor in the esophagus or stomach\n\nA gastroenterologist may also treat small cancers of the esophagus and stomach with endoscopic therapy such as an endoscopic mucosal resection\n\n\n\nDiagnostic radiologist\nInterpret CT or PET scans Perform biopsies under the guidance of CT or ultrasound\n\n\n\nMedical Oncologist\nTreat cancer with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, using drugs given intravenously (and sometimes by pill).\n\n\n\nRadiation Therapist\nTreats cancer with high-energy x-rays that target tumors in the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes. A radiation therapist can also be referred to as a radiation oncologist.\n\n\n\nSurgeon\nPerform surgery to remove the cancer in the esophagus and surrounding lymph nodes and reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract.\nA surgeon may also place a feeding tube if needed, and place a central venous port for chemotherapy.\n\n\n\nDietitian\nFor patients with esophageal cancer, getting adequate nutrition can be a challenge. Frequently the tumor itself can make it difficult to swallow. In addition, cancer therapy can affect your appetite. Some patients will require a temporary feeding tube to help with their nutrition.\nIn all these cases, a dietitian can help you make sure that your body receives the nutrition it needs.\n\n\n\nNurses\nIn every step along the way in your journey with esophageal cancer, there will be nurses who will help implement the treatment plan. They are a great source of information for any questions that arise during your treatment.\n\n\n\nSupport Staff\nThe diagnosis of esophageal cancer affects more than just the esophagus - It affects the whole person and the whole family. Most cancer centers will have a wide variety of services to help you and your family navigate the process. Some examples:\n\nCounselors and psychologists to help with\nFinancial counselors\nPalliative Care team to help with symptom control\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask about resource which may be available at your cancer center.\n\n\n\nYour personal team\nThese are perhaps the most important members of your treatment team. They are family members, friends or neighbors who can help you on this journey you are about to begin. You may find that you will need some help from time to time during your treatment for esophageal cancer. Please don’t be afraid to ask for help - you may be surprised at how willing the people close to you are to help.\nIt can also be very helpful to find someone close to you who can come with you to medical appointments. It can be very helpful to have an extra set of eyes and ears to make sure there is good communication with your care team.\n\n\n\nTreatment Options\nThe next video discusses Treatment Options for esophageal cancer.\nEsophageal Cancer Treatment Options\n\nWe hope you have found this video helpful.

    "text": "Introduction\nEsophageal cancer is frequently treated with chemotherapy. A central venous port can make that easier.\nI’m Dr Jonathan Salo, I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon.\nIn this video you’ll learn about a central venous port, which is used to administer chemotherapy.\n\nMost chemotherapy for esophageal cancer is administered into a vein. Because some of the chemotherapy can be irritating to the veins, it can be easier for some patients to have a central venous port placed.\nThe port is surgically placed under the skin, and is completely implanted just underneath the skin. You can shower, bath, and even swim with the port in place.\n\nThe port contains a small chamber into which a needle can be placed when it is time to use the port. A thin tube, or catheter, leads into a large blood vessel.\n\nWhen it comes time for chemotherapy, the nurses can easily access the port with a needle that goes through the skin into the port, rather than placing an intravenous needle in a vein. The drugs can then be administered directly into the bloodstream. If blood needs to be drawn for tests, this can also be done through the port.\n\nTypically, the port is placed in the operating room under sterile conditions. A 1 inch incision made below the collar bone, and frequently a smaller incision is made in the neck. The procedure is done an an outpatient, so you can go home the same day.\n\nThe care of a port after surgery is very easy, as there are no tubes outside the body to worry about.\nThe sutures are all under the skin and will dissolve on their own. The incision should be dry for at least 24 hours. We recommend no heavy lifting for the first week to avoid bruising.\n\nTypially, the incisions will be covered with a surgical glue which will flake off after a week or so.\nFor patients with difficulty eating, a feeding tube can be placed at the same time as the port.\n\nIf you or a family member have had experience with a central venous port, I would love to hear about it, so please take a minute to leave a comment below. We’re constantly creating new videos, so please subscribe to be notified of new videos when we post them.\n\nHere are some additional videos you may find helpful:\nLocally Advanced Esophageal Cancer"

Staging is the process of finding out the size of the tumor and whether or not there has been spread to the lymph nodes or other places in the body.\nOnce the stage has been determined, it will be possible to determine the best therapy\n\nIn order to determine the stage, we will focus on three different areas:\nThe first is the tumor. How large is the tumor? And more importantly, how deeply has it grown into the wall of the esophagus?\nThe second is whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe third is whether there is metastasis or spread to other parts of the body\n\nSome drawings will help. The wall of the esophagus or stomach has multiple layers, shown here.\n\n\n\nEsophagus Tumors\n\n\n\nSurrounding the esophagus and stomach are lymph nodes. The purpose of lymph nodes is to filter the blood and help fight infections, but in some cases cancers in the esophagus can spread to the lymph nodes\n\nIn its earliest stages, cancer of the esophagus or stomach starts on the inner, or most superficial layer, called with mucosa.\nWith time, however, the cancer can continue to grow and invade deeper into the wall of the esophagus or stomach. The deeper the cancer invades into the wall, the more likely it is that cancer cells can spread elsewhere\n\nIf cancer cells spread to the lymph nodes, there is a chance that some cells will break off and spread to the liver or lungs.\nMetastasis is spread to other parts of the body such as liver, lungs, or bone.\n\nTo review, the stage consists of 3 parts:\n\nT for Tumor\nN for Nodes\nM for Metastasis"

Esophagectomy surgery removes the tumor and the surrounding lymph nodes. In some cases, however, there is a risk of microscopic disease that can’t be seen and can’t be removed by surgery alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor patients with esophageal cancer that is either T3 or Node-positive, research has shown that initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy makes the surgery more effective by killing microscopic tumor cells that can’t be detected at the time of surgery.\nResearch has shown that a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation, followed by surgery, is the more effective than surgery alone for T3 or node-positive tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n!!!

And more importantly, how deeply has it grown into the wall of the esophagus?\nThe second is whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe third is whether there is metastasis or spread to other parts of the body\n\nSome drawings will help. The wall of the esophagus has multiple layers, shown here.\n\n\n\nEsophagus Tumors\n\n\n\nSurrounding the esophagus are lymph nodes. The purpose of lymph nodes is to filter the blood and help fight infections, but in some cases cancers in the esophagus can spread to the lymph nodes\n\nIn its earliest stages, cancer of the esophagus starts on the inner, or most superficial layer, called with mucosa.\nWith time, however, the cancer can continue to grow and invade deeper into the wall of the esophagus. The deeper the cancer invades into the wall of the esophagus, the more likely it is that cancer cells can spread elsewhere\n\nIf cancer cells spread to the lymph nodes, there is a chance that some cells will break off and spread to the liver or lungs.\nMetastasis is spread to other parts of the body such as liver, lungs, or bone.\n\nTo review, the stage consists of 3 parts:\n\nT for Tumor\nN for Nodes\nM for Metastasis"

    "text": "Introduction\nI’m Dr Jonathan Salo, I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nEsophageal cancer can cause difficulty with swallowing, which can limit your body’s ability to get the nutrition you need in order to keep your body healthy during cancer treatment.\n\nIn this video you’ll learn about\n\nEssential building blocks for good nutrition\nNutritional drinks\nFeeding tubes\n\n\nThere are four major nutritional building block:\n\nCarbohydrates\nProtein\nFats\nVitamins and Minerals\n\n\nCarbohydrates are important for energy\nThere are many different kinds of carbohydrates:\nThere are sugars, which make food taste sweet but may also raise your blood sugar\nThere are starches, which also provide a source of energy but are easier on your system. Starches are large molecules made up of a long chain of sugars, but don’t take sweet, are are found in food such as bread and potatoes.\n\nFats are a second category of nutrients. Fats make food taste better and are important in small quantities for rebuilding tissue. Fat is found in oil, butter, shortening, and fried foods. The average American diet, however, contains more fat than most people need\n\nVitamins and minerals are needed to keep your body running smoothly. A daily vitamin is enough for most people. In some cases, your doctor may recommend iron supplementation, but only if your iron levels are low\n\n\n\nProtein\nProtein is the essential building block of tissue in your body, especially muscle. If you don’t have enough protein in your diet, you can lose muscle mass, which can result in weakness and fatigue\n\nProtein is found in meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and beans. Your dietitian can give you a more precise number, but in general the average woman needs 60 grams of protein per day and the average man needs 75 grams of protein per day. You may need even more protein during cancer treatment in order to rebuild damaged tissue.\n\nFor many people with esophageal cancer, however, eating meat can be difficult. Because of this, inadequate protein intake is the most common nutritional problem for patients with esophageal cancer.\n\nFor patients who have difficulty eating, we recommend nutritional drinks to make certain they have enough protein to stay healthy.\n\nWhen we talk about nutritional drinks, we will talk about two different categories:\n\nProtein Shakes\nMeal Replacements\n\n\nProtein shakes contain protein and flavoring and may contain micronutrients, but don’t tend to contain much in the way of carbohydrates or fat. An example of a protein shake would be Premier Protein or Pure Protein.\n\n\n\nMeal Replacements\nMeal replacements contain protein as well as carbohydrates, along with fats. Examples of meal replacements would be Ensure or Boost.\n\nYour dietitian will help decide whether a protein shake or meal replacement is best for you, but for most patients that are able to take at least some other food, protein shakes taste better and are usually more suitable.\n\nBear in mind that the average woman need 60 grams of protein per day, and the average man needs 75 grams of protein per day, so it will be important to read the label to make certain you’re getting enough protein\n\nFor most people with esophageal cancer who have difficulty eating, things can get worse during esophageal cancer therapy. The reason is that the most common initial treatment in chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nChemotherapy can tend to depress your appetite. Radiation can lead to a temporary ‘sunburn’ on the inside of the esophagus called radiation esophagitis. This usually gets better after the radiation ends, but during the radiation it can make it more difficult to swallow. Swallowing usually gets better within the first 2 to 3 weeks after the end of radiation.\n\nOne of the questions you will want to address with your esophageal cancer care team is whether or not you need a feeding tube to help with your nutrition during cancer treatment. Your dietitian and physicians will evaluate your situation and made a recommendation. Let’s take a look at the options:\n\nA gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach by a surgical procedure. Feedings can be administered with a syringe. A gastrostomy tube still allows you to each as much as you would like.\nA jejunostomy tube is placed into the jejunum, or the small intestine. Feedings require a pump and are generally given overnight, which can take 12-16 hours. A jejunostomy tube still allows you to each as much as you would like.\n\nThe decision between a gastrostomy tube and jejunostomy tube can be a little complex, but here are some general principles. For those with stomach cancer who need supplemental feeding, a jejunostomy tube is needed.\nFor patients who undergo surgery on the esophagus, a jejunostomy tube is frequently used after surgery\n\nFor patients who have esophageal cancer and who are undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, either a gastrostomy tube or jejunostomy tube can be used, depending upon whether or not surgery on the esophagus is planned. This is a more complicated decision that your care team will make in coordination with your surgeon.\n\nIf you or a family member have had an encounter with esophageal cancer, I would love to hear about your experience, so please take a minute to leave a comment below.

In this video, you will learn about Early Stage esophageal cancer\n\nFor a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.\nSo patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:\n\nA small group who don’t have any difficulty eating that have early stage disease\nMajority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have advanced disease.\n\n–\nAmong those with Advanced disease, there are two categories:\n\nLocally Advanced -&gt; T3 or N+ -&gt; Treated with a combination of chemotherapy + radiation, followed by surgery\nMetastatic -&gt; Treated with chemotherapy\n\nFor more information about advanced esophageal cancer, there is a link above and in the description. Advanced\n\nIn this video, you will learn about Early Stage esophageal tumors. These generally don’t cause any difficulty with eating or swallowing. They may cause bleeding or symptoms of heartburn, but generally don’t cause trouble eating or weight loss.\nEarly Stage cancers are those that are T1 or T2 and N0M0.\nIf you haven’t seen it already, please see the video about esophageal cancer diagnosis and staging to give you an overview.\nEsophageal Cancer Diagnosis and Staging\n\nIn short, early stage cancers consist of small tumors without involvement of the lymph nodes, and they are either T1 or T2.\nT1 tumors are treated very differently from T2 tumors, to it is important to distinguish between the two.\n\nEndoscopic ultrasound is the best test to distinguish T1 tumors from T2 tumors. From a patient’s perspective it’s very similar to an upper endoscopy. Under sedation, the gastroenterologist places a scope through the mouth into the esophagus. The difference is that at the end of the scope, there is located a tiny ultrasound probe, which can measure the tumor in the esophagus.\n\nThe endoscopic ultrasound will give one of three answers:\nT1 tumor -&gt; can frequently be treated through the endoscope, without the need for surgery. We’ll discuss that more later\nT2 -&gt; Are usually treated with surgery\nT3 -&gt; Treated with a combination of chemotherapy\n\n\nT1 Esophageal Cancers\nT1 tumors involve only the mucosa, the layer on the inner surface of the esophagus. Because these tumors do not invade deeply, it is often possible to remove them using a scope. In some cases, the tumor can be treated without the need for surgery. Endoscopic removal of tumor is called endoscopic mucosal resection\n\n\n\nEndoscopic Musocal Resection\nFor the patient’s perspective, the procedure is similar to an endoscopy, which is done under sedation. Fluid is injected underneath the tumor, which raises a sort of blister. The top layer (and the tumor) are then removed. The procedure is done as an outpatient.\n\n\n\nPathology\nThe pathologist then examines the specimen to see whether the tumor has been removed completely\n\n(favorable) In an ideal circumstance, the tumor is confined to the center of the area which has been removed, ensuring that there is no tumor left behind.\nA tumor is judged to be favorable for endoscopic mucosal resection if the tumor appears to be slow growing and the margins are clear, which suggests that the tumor was completely removed.\n\n\n\nSurveillance\nWhen a small tumor has been completely removed by endoscopic mucosal resection, frequently no further therapy is required. In this case, follow up endoscopy is recommended to be certain that there is no recurrence.\n\nUnfavorable: If a tumor is removed with endoscopic mucosal resection and it appears as though the tumor may not have been completely removed or is more rapidly growing, this is considered an unfavorable outcome.
