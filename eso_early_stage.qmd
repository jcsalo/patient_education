The topic of this video is early-stage adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroephageal junction. (2)

## Esophagus or Gastroesophageal junction *2*.

We will consider cancers of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction together, as the treatment is similar (3)

## Treatment is guided by the Stage of cancer

The treatment recommended will depend upon the stage of the cancer. If you haven't already, this may be a good time to view the video on Diagnosis and Staging. (4)

## Mucosa

The wall of the esophagus consists of three main layers. On the inside is the mucosa. (5)

## Submucosa

Underneath the mucosa is the submucosa. (6)

## Muscularis

Outside fo the mucosa are two layers of muscle, called the Muscularis. (7)

## T1a

Esophageal cancer starts within the mucosa, and with time can invade deeper into the wall. The depth of invasion into the wall (8)

## T1b

With time, the cancer can grow deeper and invade the submucosa (9)

## T2

The cancer can then invade into the muscularis (10)

## T3

If not treated, the cancer will then grow all the way through the muscularis (11)

## T1a (labeled)

A cancer confined to the mucosa is classified as T1a (12)

## T1b

A cancer which invades into the submucosa is classified as T1b (13)

## T2

A cancer which invades the muscularis is classified as T2 (14)

## T3

A cancer which grows through the muscularis is classified as T3 (15)
