## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upon the cancer stage**

## Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

\
\

-   **T** = Tumor - Depth of growth into the wall of the esophagus\
    \
-   **N** = Nodes - Spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **M** = Metastasis - Spread to liver, lungs, or bone

## Layers of the Wall 

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If we look at the walls of digestive tract, we see several layers:
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mucosa - Inner layer\
    \
-   Muscle wall (muscularis)\
    \
-   Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle

## Early Stage Cancers

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Early-stage cancers are those that are small and have not grown very far into the wall
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa

## Locally-advanced Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall

:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Locally-advanced cancers are those that have grown through the wall
:::

## Lymph Nodes

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor25b_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If the lymph nodes contain enough cancer cells, they can be seen on CT scans or PET scans
:::

## T Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as the T stage
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t_full.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
T1 tumors are early stage, and T4 tumors more advanced
:::

## N Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **N1** cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.

:::
::::
::::::

## M Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some cancers spread from the esophagus to other parts of the body

-   **M0** cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
-   **M1** cancers have spread lungs, liver, or bone

## PET scan

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to light up areas of cancer.
:::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}

:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
In some cases, the PET scan is not performed until a CT scans bas been done.
:::

## Endoscopic Ultrasound

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Similar to upper endoscopy (EGD)
-   Ultrasound probe in scope
-   Evaluates T stage of cancer
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}

:::

::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Endoscopic ultrasound is most helpful in early stage cancers.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdomen
-   Areas of spread can be very small (grain of rice)
-   Laparoscopy can detect spread inside the abdomen
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}

:::

::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Not all patients with esophageal cancer need a laparoscopy.

In general, laparoscopy is considered for cancers that invade from the esophagus into the stomach.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

-   Several incisions 1/4" long
-   A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.
-   Biopsies can be performed.
