## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upon the cancer stage**

## Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

-   **T** = Tumor - Depth of growth into the wall\
    \
-   **N** = Nodes - Spread to the lymph nodes\
    \
-   **M** = Metastasis - Spread to liver, lungs, or bone



## Early Stage Cancers

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Early-stage cancers are those that are small and have not grown very far into the wall
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers start on the very inside layer called the mucosa

## Locally-advanced Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Locally-advanced cancers are those that have grown through the wall
:::

## Lymph Nodes

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If the lymph nodes contain enough cancer cells, they can be seen on CT scans or PET scans
:::

## T Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
\
\
Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as the T stage
:::

:::

::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
T1 tumors are early stage, and T4 tumors more advanced
:::

## N Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the nodes
-   **N1** cancers have spread to the nodes.

## M Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some cancers spread to other parts of the body

-   **M0** cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
-   **M1** cancers have spread lungs, liver, or bone

## PET scan

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}

PET scan is similar to CT scan

- Tracer shows 'hot spots'
  - Cancer
  - Inflammation or infection
  - Normal organs (heart)

In some cases, the PET scan is not performed until a CT scans bas been done.

## Endoscopic Ultrasound

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Similar to upper endoscopy (EGD)
-   Ultrasound in scope
-   Evaluates T stage

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Endoscopic ultrasound is most helpful in early stage cancers.
