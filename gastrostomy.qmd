# GI Tract Anatomy


Normally, food passes from the mouth into the esophagus, and then into the stomach. The stomach serves as a reservoir for food, to allow you to eat a big Thanksgiving. The stomach starts digestion, and then after the meal slowly allows small portions of food to pass into the small intestines, where most of the digestion occurs.

---

For patients with cancer of the esophagus or stomach, the most common feeding tube is a jejunostomy tube

---

For patients with cancer of the esophagus, there are two different kinds of feeding tube which can be used:

A gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach

A jejunostomy tube is placed in the small intestines

Your dietitian and physician will help you decide which tube is best for your situation

---


Gastrostomy tube

• Placed into stomach

Jejunostomy tube

• Placed into small intestine

---

Feeding Gastrostomy

A gastrostomy tube allows feeding with a syringe, which can be done several times per day.

When it’s not being used, the gastrostomy tube can be hidden underneath clothing.

For patient who later need surgery on the esophagus, it will be necessary to remove the

gastrostomy tube and place a jejunostomy tube, as the stomach frequently used to create a new

esophagus

---

A gastrostomy tube can be placed either by endoscopy, which is called a PEG tube

A gastrostomy tube can also be placed by laparoscopy, which is usually preferred if

surgery on the esophagus is planned in the future.

Your surgeon will help you decide which kind of tube is best for you. This is especially important 
if you will need esophageal surgery in the future, as the stomach is frequently used to make a new esophagus

---

A gastrostomy tube is generally placed as an  outpatient, which means you can go home the 
same day.

In some cases, a central venous port for chemotherapy is placed at the same time as a gastrostomy tube.

---

The other type of feeding tube is a jejunostomy.


A jejunostomy tube tube is placed into the small  intestines. Because the small intestine is used to receiving food in small quantities, a jejunostomy tube requires the use of a pump to deliver feedings gradually over a matter of hours.

In general, feedings are done at night in order to allow you to be active during the day

---

A jejunostomy tube is used in cases where it’s not possible to place a gastrostomy tube, such as when there is a tumor in the stomach. A jejunostomy tube is routinely used after esophageal surgery, so in patients who need help with nutrition prior to surgery, it makes sense to put in a jejunostomy tube before surgery. The same tube can then be used for nutrition both before and after surgery.
