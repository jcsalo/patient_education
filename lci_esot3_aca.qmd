## Anatomy

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}

Food moves from the throat

$\rightarrow$ esophagus

$\rightarrow$ stomach

$\rightarrow$ small bowel (jejunum)

We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Treatment Plan

\
- Superficial (T1) $\Rightarrow$ Endoscopic Therapy\
\
- Localized (T1b/T2) $\Rightarrow$ Surgery\
\
- Locally-advanced (T3/N1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemo$\pm$Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery\
\
- Metastatic (M1) $\Rightarrow$ Chemotherapy

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Locally-advanced cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer often have localized spread of cancer cells in the surrounding area

## Locally-advanced cancers

If locally-advanced cancers are treated with surgery alone...

There is a risk that cancer cells can be left behind

## Preoperative Therapy

It is helpful to start with therapy *before* surgery that will shrink the cancer.

## Adenocarcinoma Treatment Options

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**CROSS Chemo + Radiation**

-   Longer track record (2010)
-   Better tolerated
-   Port usually placed
-   Eating gets worse $\rightarrow$ better
-   May need feeding tube
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**FLOT Chemotherapy**

-   More effective than CROSS
-   More side effects
-   Port always required
-   Eating gets slowly better
-   Less likely to need feeding tube

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy
