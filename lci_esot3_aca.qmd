## Anatomy

::::::: columns

Food moves from the throat

$\rightarrow$ esophagus

$\rightarrow$ stomach

$\rightarrow$ small bowel (jejunum)

We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Treatment Plan

::::::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
::: fragment
Superficial (T1)

-   Endoscopic Therapy
:::

::: fragment
Localized (T1b/T2)

-   Surgery (esophagectomy)
:::

::: fragment
Locally-advanced (T3M0)

-   Chemo$\pm$Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery
:::

::: fragment
Metastatic (M1)

-   Chemotherapy
:::
:::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Tumor Biomarkers - Pathology Tests

Show whether other drugs may be helpful:

-   HER-2 $\rightarrow$ Herceptin can be helpful
-   PD-L1 $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be helpful
-   MMR $\rightarrow$ Immunotherapy can be very helpful

Biomarkers reported in a separate pathology report

Your medical oncologist will review these with you

## Adenocarcinoma Treatment Options

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Chemo + Radiation**

-   Longer track record
-   Better tolerated
-   Port usually placed
-   Eating worse $\rightarrow$ better
-   May need feeding tube
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Chemotherapy**

-   More effective
-   More side effects
-   Port always required
-   Eating slowly improves
-   Less likely to need feeding tube

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy
