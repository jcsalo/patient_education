## 1 Intro

I'm Dr Jonathan Salo, a GI Cancer Surgeon at the in Charlotte, North Carolina
If youâ€™re seeing this video, changes are you or someone close to you has had an encounter with esophageal cancer.
These videos are designed to educate you about cancer and its treatment and help you and you cancer care team make the right decisions for you.


## 4 Esophageal Cancer (2)

For a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.

So patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:

-   A small group who don't have any difficulty eating that have *early* stage disease
-   Majority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have *advanced* disease.

## Esophageal Cancer (3)

This video will focus on Advanced Stage Disease

We will post videos about early stage disease, so take a look in the description.


## Advanced Stage (4)

Advanced *advanced* esophageal cancer, which consists of two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic.

-   Locally Advanced -\> T3M0
-   Metastatic -\> M1


If this terminology is not familiar to you, please refer to our video on Diagnosis and Staging. There is a link above and in the description below.

## Locally Advanced

Locally-advanced cancers are M0, which means that

Locally-advanced tumors are usually T3, meaning that the tumor has grow through the wall of the esophagus *AND* there is *no* signs of spread to other organs, so they are M0

Metastatic esophageal cancer is a case where there has been spread to other organs such as the liver or lungs. These are considered stage M1.

For patients with Metastatic tumors that are M1, the usual treatment is chemotherapy. In most cases, this is given intravenously through a central venous port. Chemotherapy is administered under the care of a Medical Oncologist.

We have a link to a video about metastatic esophageal cancer here: [GE Metastatic](ge_metastatic.html)

## Nutrition

For many patients with advanced cancers, nutrition is a challenge because the tumor can make it difficult to eat. You may find a consultation with a *Dietitian* to be helpful. Some patients with advanced esophageal cancer will need a *feeding tube* to help support their nutrition during their cancer treatment.

## Treatment

For patients with Locally Advanced tumors that are T3 and M0, the usual treatment is a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery called trimodality therapy.

Once the staging studies are complete, you and your esophageal cancer treatment team can design a treatment plan for you and your cancer.

## Histology

To make things a bit more complicated, the best treatment for esophageal *adenocarcinoma* is different from that of *squamous cell carcinoma*.

In general, squamous cell carcinoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy lasting about 5 1/2 weeks. We have a video here about treatment of squamous cell carcinoma. [Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment](eso_scca_locally_advanced.html)

## Adenocarcinoma

On the other hand, the treatment of adenocaricinoma is a bit more complex. Until recently, most patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. There is new evidence, however, that chemotherapy alone may also be helpful. We have video here about treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. [Adenocarcinoa Treatment](eso_aca_locally_advanced.html)

At the end of this video there will be links to additional videos which address locally-advanced esophageal cancer and metastatic esophageal cancer. This way, if you already know the results of the staging studies, you can view specific information.
