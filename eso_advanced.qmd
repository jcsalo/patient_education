## 1 Intro

I'm Dr Jonathan Salo, a GI Cancer Surgeon at the in Charlotte, North Carolina
If youâ€™re seeing this video, changes are you or someone close to you has had an encounter with esophageal cancer.
These videos are designed to educate you about cancer and its treatment and help you and you cancer care team make the right decisions for you.

Of course, there is no substitute for the expert opinions of your cancer care team.


## 4 Esophageal Cancer (2)

For a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.

So patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:

-   A small group who don't have any difficulty eating that have *early* stage disease
-   Majority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have *advanced* disease.

## Esophageal Cancer (3)

This video will focus on Advanced Stage Disease

We will post videos about early stage disease, so take a look in the description.


## Advanced Stage Cancer (4)

 *Advanced* esophageal cancer consists of two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic.

-   Locally Advanced -\> T3M0
-   Metastatic -\> M1


## 2 Metastatic Cancer:M1 (5)

Metastatic cancers are those that have signs of spread to other organs such as the lungs, liver, or bones.

These cancers are treated primarily with chemotherapy.

We have other videos that focus on metastatic cancers.

## Locally-advanced: M0 (6)

Locally-advanced cancers are M0, which means there is no evidence of metastasis, or spread to other parts of the body.  In addition, they are T3 or node-positive

## Locally-advanced: T3 or N+ (7)

Locally-advanced cancers are not only M0, but they are T3 or node-positive.

If this terminology is not familiar to you, please refer to our video on Diagnosis and Staging. There is a link above and in the description below.

## 4 Types of Esophageal Cancer (8)

To make things a bit more complicated, there are two types of esophageal cancer: Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

The treatment is in many ways similar, but there are enough differences that we will have a separate video that focuses on squamous cell carcinoma.

I hope you have found this video helpful. This videos and others like it are designed to educate patients and families about esophageal cancer and equip them for their discussions with their esophageal cancer care team.

As always, these videos are no substitute for expert medical advice.

## Nutrition

For many patients with advanced cancers, nutrition is a challenge because the tumor can make it difficult to eat. You may find a consultation with a *Dietitian* to be helpful. Some patients with advanced esophageal cancer will need a *feeding tube* to help support their nutrition during their cancer treatment.


## Histology

To make things a bit more complicated, the best treatment for esophageal *adenocarcinoma* is different from that of *squamous cell carcinoma*.

In general, squamous cell carcinoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy lasting about 5 1/2 weeks. We have a video here about treatment of squamous cell carcinoma. [Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment](eso_scca_locally_advanced.html)

## Adenocarcinoma

On the other hand, the treatment of adenocaricinoma is a bit more complex. Until recently, most patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. There is new evidence, however, that chemotherapy alone may also be helpful. We have video here about treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. [Adenocarcinoa Treatment](eso_aca_locally_advanced.html)

At the end of this video there will be links to additional videos which address locally-advanced esophageal cancer and metastatic esophageal cancer. This way, if you already know the results of the staging studies, you can view specific information.
