## 1 Intro

I'm Dr Jonathan Salo, a GI Cancer Surgeon at the in Charlotte, North Carolina
If youâ€™re seeing this video, changes are you or someone close to you has had an encounter with esophageal cancer.
These videos are designed to educate you about cancer and its treatment and help you and you cancer care team make the right decisions for you.

Of course, there is no substitute for the expert opinions of your cancer care team.


## 4 Esophageal Cancer (2)

For a refresher, esophageal cancer, as it grows, can tends to make it difficult for patients to swallow.

So patients with esophageal cancer fit into two main groups:

-   A small group who don't have any difficulty eating that have *early* stage disease
-   Majority of patients who have some difficulty eating or may have weight loss who have *advanced* disease.

## Esophageal Cancer (3)

This video will focus on Advanced Stage Disease

We will post videos about early stage disease, so take a look in the description.


## Advanced Stage Cancer (4)

 *Advanced* esophageal cancer consists of two categories: Locally Advanced and Metastatic.

-   Locally Advanced -\> T3M0
-   Metastatic -\> M1


## 2 Metastatic Cancer:M1 (5)

Metastatic cancers are those that have signs of spread to other organs such as the lungs, liver, or bones.

These cancers are treated primarily with chemotherapy.

We have other videos that focus on metastatic cancers.

## Locally-advanced: M0 (6)

Locally-advanced cancers are M0, which means there is no evidence of metastasis, or spread to other parts of the body.  In addition, they are T3 or node-positive

## Locally-advanced: T3 or N+ (7)

Locally-advanced cancers are not only M0, but they are T3 or node-positive.

If this terminology is not familiar to you, please refer to our video on Diagnosis and Staging. There is a link above and in the description below.

## 4 Types of Esophageal Cancer (8)

To make things a bit more complicated, there are two types of esophageal cancer: Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

The treatment is in many ways similar, but there are enough differences that we will have a separate video that focuses on squamous cell carcinoma. 

## Types of Esophageal Cancer (9)

This video will focus on locally-advanced *adenocarcinoma*


## (6) Locally Advanced (10)

Locally-advanced cancers frequently have localized spread of cancer cells outside of the visible tumor.

##  Locally Advanced (11)

Surgery removed the visible tumor and the surrounding tissue, but does not always remove microscopic spread of cancer which can't be seen with the naked eye.

##  Locally Advanced (12)

If surgery is performed as the only therapy for locally-advanced cancer, there is a risk that cancer cells can be left behind

##  Locally Advanced (13)

Preoperative therapy is administered before surgery

##  Locally Advanced (14)

And is designed to kill cancer cells in the tumor, nodes, and any cancer cells in the surrounding area

##  Locally Advanced (15)

This therapy typically involves chemotherapy

##  Locally Advanced (16)

Which can circulate all throughout the body

##  Locally Advanced (17)

Chemotherapy can be combined with radiation in some cases

##  Locally Advanced (18)

The overall goal is shrinking the tumor and killing nearby cancer cells


##  Locally Advanced (19)

After preoperative therapy has shrunk the tumor and any other cancer cells, surgery can be performed

##  Locally Advanced (20)

Preoperative therapy combined with surgery offers the best chance to remove all of the cancer, without leaving any behind

## (4) Adenocarcinoma Preoperative Therapy (21)

For adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, there are two different approaches to preoperative therapy.

One uses chemotherapy and radiation together, followed by surgery

The other uses chemotherapy before and after surgery, without radiation therapy

##  Chemotherapy + Radiation -> Surgery (22)

The chemotherapy and radiation strategy uses chemotherapy and radiation together

Chemotherapy is given intraveneously once per week for 6 weeks

Radiation is given five days per week for 6 weeks

##  Chemotherapy + Radiation -> Surgery (23)

The chemotherapy is a low dose, designed to make the radiation more effective

The therapy is generally well tolerated

## (2) CROSS Clinical Trial (24)

The effectiveness of this approach was proven scientifically in the CROSS clinical trial

This was a scientific study published in 2010

363 patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer were divided into two treatment groups:

One group was treated with surgery alone

The other group was treated with chemotherapy and radiation first, followed by surgery

##  CROSS Clinical Trial (25)

The results of the trial were quite dramatic: There was better control of the cancer in the group that received chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery. This group had longer survival than the group treated with surgery alone.

##  CROSS Clinical Trial (26)

For the past 15 years, chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery, was established as the most effective therapy. This is known as trimodality therapy, beause it uses a combination of three different therapies.

## Nutrition

For many patients with advanced cancers, nutrition is a challenge because the tumor can make it difficult to eat. You may find a consultation with a *Dietitian* to be helpful. Some patients with advanced esophageal cancer will need a *feeding tube* to help support their nutrition during their cancer treatment.


## Histology

To make things a bit more complicated, the best treatment for esophageal *adenocarcinoma* is different from that of *squamous cell carcinoma*.

In general, squamous cell carcinoma is treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy lasting about 5 1/2 weeks. We have a video here about treatment of squamous cell carcinoma. [Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment](eso_scca_locally_advanced.html)

## Adenocarcinoma

On the other hand, the treatment of adenocaricinoma is a bit more complex. Until recently, most patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. There is new evidence, however, that chemotherapy alone may also be helpful. We have video here about treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. [Adenocarcinoa Treatment](eso_aca_locally_advanced.html)

At the end of this video there will be links to additional videos which address locally-advanced esophageal cancer and metastatic esophageal cancer. This way, if you already know the results of the staging studies, you can view specific information.
