Videos are set up as a combination of .png images 1920x1080 generated by PowerPoint, in combination with a script in .docx format.

The .docx file is uploaded to GitHub pages, then downloaded into files in the iPad

From here, the .docx script is loaded into the S-Teleprompter app.

The teleprompter remote is then linked to the iPad via Bluetooth




## Titles and Images for Videos

Slideshows are made in PowerPoint which contain titles and images. In order for OBS to use these images, it is necessary to have a folder of PNG images with transparent background.  A image source is then created which points to that folder.

In order to show the images in the correct order it is necessary to import the PNG images them as files (rather than as a directory)

In order for PowerPoint to export with a transparent background (which is required for overlay titles) it is necessary to select all the objects on a slide, then right click and export as a PNG image.

### New workflow November 2025:

Keynote can export PNG images with a transparent background.

Select all sides, then choose fill "No fill"

When exporting, check the 'Export as transparent PNG'

**Question: Can we build titles/images in Keynote??**
