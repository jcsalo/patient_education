Videos are set up as a combination of .png images 1920x1080 generated by PowerPoint, in combination with a script in .docx format.

The .docx file is uploaded to GitHub pages, then downloaded into files in the iPad

From here, the .docx script is loaded into the S-Teleprompter app.

The teleprompter remote is then linked to the iPad via Bluetooth
