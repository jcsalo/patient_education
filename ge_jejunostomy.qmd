## Introduction. *1*

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo, I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Because the esophagus and stomach are so important in digestion, cancers of the esophagus or stomach can make it difficult to get the nutrients you need.

A feeding tube can help nutrition in these cases.

In this video you’ll learn about one type of feeding tube, the feeding jejunostomy.

## Types of Feeding Tubes. L *4*

There are two categories of feeding tubes:

- Gastrostomy tubes are placed in the stomach

- Jejunostomy tubes are placed into the jejunum, the first portion of the small bowel

This video focuses on jejunostomy tubes. Gastrostomy tubes are the focus of another video.

## Anatomy

Food travels from the esophagus to the stomach, and then into the duodenum, and then into the first part of the small intestine called the jejunum.

## Anatomy II

The stomach serves as a reservoir for food, and beging the process of digestion.  The stomach then pushes food through the pylorus muscle into the duodenum.  The stomach releases only a small quantity of food at a time becasue the small intestine can become easily overwhelmed by too much food at one time

## Jejunostomy

Because the small bowel can only handle a small amount of food at a time, it is necessary to use a pump to administer jejunostomy feedings over a long period of time, typically 12 to 16 hours.

A jejunostomy tube has a portion on the inside located inside the small bowel, and a portion outside which is connected to a feeding tube pump.


## Jejunostomy 5 cartons

An 8oz carton of a "1.5" feeding tube fromula contains 360 calories and 15 grams of protein

An average-sized man who gets all of his nutrition from the feeding tube needs about 5 cartons per day, which would give 75 grams of protein daily.

Five cartons of tube feeds is 1200mL per day.  This can be given over a 16 hour period at a rate of 75mL/hour.

## Jejunostomy 4 cartons

An average-sized woman or smaller man who gets all of their nutrition from the feeding tube needs about 4 cartons per day, which would give 60 grams of protein daily.

Four cartons of tube feeds is 960mL per day.  This can be given over a 16 hour period at a rate of 60mL/hour.

## Water

In addition to tube feed formula 

Feedings are typically 


-   Jejunostomy tube feeds for 16 hours (6pm-10am)
    -   Men: 75mL/hour x 16 hours = 5 cartons
    -   Women: 60mL/hour x 16 hours = 4 cartons
-   Water 240ml (8oz) via syringe 4x/day

Hospital nurses will teach use of the feeding tube

## Jejunostomy Feeds with Diabetes

Jejunostomy feedings elevate blood sugars

-   Insulin may be required along with feeds

Typical Pattern for tube feeds

-   Feeds run via pump from 6pm to 10am
-   Insulin at 6pm (70/30 insulin)
-   Insulin at Midnight (70/30 insulin)
-   No insulin if tube feedings are not run
