\subsection{Anatomy}\label{anatomy}

Food moves from the throat

\(\rightarrow\) esophagus

\(\rightarrow\) stomach

\(\rightarrow\) small bowel (jejunum)

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/Eso_Anatomy_Labels.png}{]}

\subsection{Types of Esophageal
Cancer}\label{types-of-esophageal-cancer}

There are two common types of esophageal cancer

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Adenocarcinoma
\item
  Squamous Cell Carcinoma
\end{itemize}

In many ways, these to different types of esophageal cancer behave the
same.

We will see later in this video, however, that the treatment
\textbf{can} be different depending upon whether the cancer is
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

\subsection{Cancer Staging}\label{cancer-staging}

Staging refers to the tests to determine

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How large is the tumor?
\item
  Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
\item
  Has it spread to other parts of the body?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Treatment options depend upont the cancer stage}

\subsection{Esophageal Cancer Staging}\label{esophageal-cancer-staging}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{T} = Tumor - How deep has cancer grown into the wall of the
  esophagus?
\item
  \textbf{N} = Nodes - Has cancer spread to the lymph nodes?
\item
  \textbf{M} = Metastasis - Has the cancer spread to other parts of the
  body? lungs or liver?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layers of the Wall of the
Esophagus}\label{layers-of-the-wall-of-the-esophagus}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mucosa - Inner layer
\item
  Muscle Wall (muscularis)
\item
  Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor1_ai.png}

\subsection{Early Stage Cancers}\label{early-stage-cancers}

Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor21_ai.png}

\subsection{Locally-advanced Cancers}\label{locally-advanced-cancers}

Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor24_ai.png}

\subsection{Lymph Nodes}\label{lymph-nodes}

In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread
to lymph nodes

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor25b_ai.png}

\subsection{T Stage}\label{t-stage}

Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as
the T stage

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor_t_full.png}

\subsection{N Stage}\label{n-stage}

Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{N0} cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes
\item
  \textbf{N1} cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor_t3_nodes_label.png}

\subsection{M Stage}\label{m-stage}

Some cancers can also spread from the esophagus to the lungs or liver

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{M0} cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
\item
  \textbf{N1} cancers have spread to other parts of the body such as
  lungs or liver
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/Eso_M_Stage.png}

\subsection{PET scan}\label{pet-scan}

A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to
light up areas of cancer.

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/PetImage.png}

\subsection{Endoscopic Ultrasound}\label{endoscopic-ultrasound}

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a procedure similar to upper endoscopy
(EGD) which has an ultrasound probe at the bottom of the scope. This
allows measuring the thickness of the cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound can
help determine the T stage of the cancer.

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/EUSArtboard.png}

\subsection{Laparoscopy}\label{laparoscopy}

Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdominal cavity. These
areas of spread can be very small, as small as a grain of rice.

In order to detect spread within the abdominal cavity, a proceduce
called a laparoscopy can be performed in some some patients.

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/Eso_Laparoscopy.png}

\subsection{Laparoscopy}\label{laparoscopy-1}

A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Several incisions 1/4'' long
\item
  A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.
\item
  Biopsies can be performed.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/Eso_Laparoscopy.png}

\subsection{Treatment Plans}\label{treatment-plans}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Superficial (T1) \(\Rightarrow\) Endoscopic Therapy
\item
  Localized (T1b/T2) \(\Rightarrow\) Surgery
\item
  Locally-advanced (T3/N1) \(\Rightarrow\) Chemo \(\pm\) Radiation
  \(\rightarrow\)Surgery
\item
  Metastatic (M1) \(\Rightarrow\) Chemotherapy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Superficial Cancers}\label{superficial-cancers}

Superficial Cancers = T1a N0

Treatment is often with endoscopy without the need for surgery.

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/tumor21_ai.png}

\subsection{Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
(EMR)}\label{endoscopic-mucosal-resection-emr}

Endoscopic procedure to remove a superficial tumor from the inner layer
of the esophagus

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/emr_comm.png}

\subsection{Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -
Favorable}\label{endoscopic-mucosal-resection---favorable}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Clear margins at the edge \emph{AND}
\item
  Clear deep margin \emph{AND}
\item
  Tumor appears slow-growing under microscope
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/emr_favorable.png}

\subsection{Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -
Favorable}\label{endoscopic-mucosal-resection---favorable-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Clear margins at the edge \emph{AND}
\item
  Clear deep margin \emph{AND}
\item
  Tumor appears slow-growing under microscope
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/emr_favorable_160012.png}

EMR may be sufficient treatment (without surgery)

\subsection{Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -
Unfavorable}\label{endoscopic-mucosal-resection---unfavorable}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tumor at edge margin \emph{OR}
\item
  Tumor at deep margin \emph{OR}
\item
  Tumor appears rapidly-growing under microscope
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/emr_unfavorable.png}

\subsection{Endoscopic Mucosal Resection -
Unfavorable}\label{endoscopic-mucosal-resection---unfavorable-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tumor at edge margin \emph{OR}
\item
  Tumor at deep margin \emph{OR}
\item
  Tumor appears rapidly-growing under microscope
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{christmas2004_files/mediabag/emr_unfavorable_1600.png}

Esophagectomy (surgery) is standard recommendation
