## Types of Esophageal Cancer

There are two common types of esophageal cancer

-   Adenocarcinoma
-   Squamous Cell Carcinoma

In many ways, these to different types of esophageal cancer behave the same.

We will see later in this video, however, that the treatment **can** be different depending upon whether the cancer is adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

## Cancer Staging

Staging refers to the tests to determine

-   How large is the tumor?
-   Has there been spread to lymph nodes?
-   Has it spread to other parts of the body?

**Treatment options depend upont the cancer stage**

## Esophageal Cancer Staging {tbl-colwidths="[20,10,70]"}

-   **T** = Tumor - How deep has cancer grown into the wall of the esophagus?
-   **N** = Nodes - Has cancer spread to the lymph nodes?
-   **M** = Metastasis - Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body? lungs or liver?

## Layers of the Wall of the Esophagus

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If we look at the wasll of the esophagus, we see several layers:
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mucosa - Inner layer
-   Muscle Wall (muscularis)
-   Lymph nodes located in fat outside the muscle
:::

## Early Stage Cancers

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Early-stage cancers are those that are small and have not grown very far into the wall of the esophagus.
:::

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers start on the very inside of the layer called the mucosa
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

## Locally-advanced Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Over time, cancers can grow into the muscular wall
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor24_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Locally-advanced cancers are those that have gorwn through the wall of the esophagus.
:::

## Lymph Nodes

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In some cases, cancer cells can break off from the main tumor and spread to lymph nodes
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor25b_ai.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If the lymph nodes contain enough cancer cells, they can be seen on CT scans or PET scans
:::

## T Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized based upon the thickness of the tumor, known as the T stage
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/tumor_t_full.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
T1 tumors are early stage, and T4 tumors more advanced
:::

## N Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Cancers are categorized by whether there is spread to the lymph nodes.

-   **N0** cancers have not spread to the lymph nodes
-   **N1** cancers have spread to the lymph nodes.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

:::
::::
::::::

## M Stage

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some cancers can also spread from the esophagus to the lungs or liver

-   **M0** cancers have not spread to other parts of the body
-   **N1** cancers have spread to other parts of the body such as lungs or liver

## PET scan

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A PET scan is similar to a CT scan, and uses a small amount of tracer to light up areas of cancer.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/PetImage.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
In some cases, the PET scan is not performed until a CT scans bas been done.
:::

## Endoscopic Ultrasound

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a procedure similar to upper endoscopy (EGD) which has an ultrasound probe at the bottom of the scope. This allows measuring the thickness of the cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound can help determine the T stage of the cancer.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/EUSArtboard.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Endoscopic ultrasound is most helpful in early stage cancers.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some esophageal cancers can spread inside the abdominal cavity. These areas of spread can be very small, as small as a grain of rice.

In order to detect spread within the abdominal cavity, a proceduce called a laparoscopy can be performed in some some patients.
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_Laparoscopy.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
Not all patients with esophageal cancer need a laparoscopy.

In general, laparoscopy is considered for cancers that invade from the esophagus into the stomach.
:::

## Laparoscopy

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A laparoscopy is performed under a general anesthetic.

-   Several incisions 1/4" long
-   A telescope is inserted to look inside the abdominal cavity.
-   Biopsies can be performed.

## Treatment Plan

|                  |             |                                          |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Category**     | **Staging** | **Treatment**                            |
| Superficial      | T1          | Endoscopic Therapy                       |
| Localized        | T1b or T2   | Surgery                                  |
| Locally-advanced | T3 or N1    | Preoperative therapy$\rightarrow$Surgery |
| Metastatic       | M1          | Chemotherapy                             |

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.
:::

## Localized Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer have smaller tumors which have not invaded all the way throug the muscle wall and are too large to remove by endoscopic therapy
:::

:::
::::
::::::

## Localized Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Localized cancers rarely spread to the lymph nodes, which means that surgery alone can often remove the cancer completely.

Localized cancers are less likely to need chemotherapy or radiation because the cancer is localized to the wall of the esophagus.

## Localized Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Localized cancers are not very common, because most people don't know that they have esophageal cancer until they have difficulty eating. The majority of patients who have difficulty eating have a T3 tumor *and* usually need either chemotherapy and/or radiation to prevent recurrences

## Diagnosis

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Localized cancers are generally diagnosed with a combination of endoscopic ultrasound and PET scan.

-   Endoscopic ultrasound can determine the T stage
-   PET scan can look at the nearby lymph nodes

:::
::::
::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
If endoscopic ultrasound shows a T3 tumor, the tumor is locally advanced and needs preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy If PET shows N1 nodes, the tumor is locally advanced and needs preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy
:::

## Surgery

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Surgery to remove the esophagus is frequently done for localized esophageal cancers

## Surgery for Localized Esophageal Cancer

If surgery is performed, the cancer in the esophagus is examined by the pathologist to confirm the precise thickness of the tumor and its T stage

About 25% of the time, the pathologist finds that the tumor is actually T3 or N1, in which case chemotherapy and/or radiation is needed after surgery.

On the other hand, in 75% of cases surgery is all the therapy that is required and there is no need for chemotherapy and/or radiation

## Chemotherapy + Radiation for Localized Esophageal Cancer

An alternative to surgery is to start with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

We know that in some cases, chemotherapy + radiation can be curative for esophageal cancer without the need for surgery.

For adenocarcicnoma, about 25% of cases are cured with chemotherapy + radiation

For squmaous cell carcinoma, about 40% of cases are cured with chemotherapy + radiation

## Followup after Chemotherapy + Radiation

The challenge here is that it's difficult to know right away whether chemotherapy + radiation has been effective for esophageal cancer.

In most cases, scans and upper endoscopy performed after chemotherapy + radiation show no signs of cancer, but only a minority of cases are actually cured.

In can take up to two years to know with certainty whether or not an esophageal cancer has been cured by chemotherapy + radiation.

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

Over 10 years ago, researchers in the Netherlands took 363 patients with esophageal cancer and divided them into two groups. The two groups were treated differently:\

**Surgery Alone**

vs

**Chemotherapy + Radiation** $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

The results were quite dramatic: The group that was treated with all three therapies, chemotherapy and radiation and surgery, lived on average twice a long as patients who had surgery alone.

**Chemotherapy + Radiation** $\rightarrow$Surgery $\Rightarrow$ Longer Survival

Chemotherapy and radiation were given together over six weeks

## Chemotherapy + Radiation CROSS Trial

A typical schedule for chemotherapy + radiation:

-   Chemotherapy once per week for six weeks
-   Radiation five days per week for six weeks (28 treatments)
-   PET scan (or CT) 4 weeks after the end of radiation
-   Surgery 8 weeks after the end of radiation

## Chemotherapy + Radiation - Side Effects

Radiation kills cancer cells, but can also cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus.

This can make swallowing more challenging the last two weeks of therapy.

A feeding tube is sometimes needed to help with hydration and nutrition.

## Locally-advanced Adenocarcinoma

For patients with *adenocarcinoma* another option is "sandwich" chemotherapy administered before and after surgery:

Chemotherapy (8 weeks) $\rightarrow$ Surgery Chemotherapy (8 weeks)

Two different drug combinations can be used:

-   FLOT
-   FOLFOX

## "Sandwich" Chemotherapy Drugs

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously.

There are several options for intravenous access:

-   Peripheral IVs in the hand
-   PICC line (Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter)
-   Central Venous Port

## Peripheral IVs

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some patients can be treated with an intravenous line placed in the hand or arm for each dose of chemotherapy. The catheter is placed at the beginning of each dose and removed that day.

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

Surgery performed after restating, and the timing depends upon recovery from therapy.
