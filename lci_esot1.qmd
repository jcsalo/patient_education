## Types of Esophageal Cancer

There are two common types of esophageal cancer

-   Adenocarcinoma
-   Squamous Cell Carcinoma

In many ways, these to different types of esophageal cancer behave the same.

## Gastroesophageal Reflux

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A one-way valve normally keeps acid within the stomach and prevents it from entering the esophagus

## Gastroesophageal Reflux

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A one-way valve normally keeps acid within the stomach

If the valve does not work properly, acid enters the esophagus and cause heartburn and damage to the lining of the esophagus.

## Barrett's Espohagus

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Over time, the lining of the esophagus undergoes change in response to the acid.

## Dysplasia

Over a period of years, pre-cancerous changes can develop within Barrett's esopahgus.

These changes can be seen by the pathologist from biopsies taken from the esophagus

::: fragment
Over time, low-grade dysplasia can progress to high-grade dysplasia
:::

## Dysplasia $\rightarrow$ Cancer

Low grade dysplasia: Risk of cancer 0.5% per year

::: fragment
High-grade dysplasia: Risk of cancer 5% per year
:::

::: fragment
$\Rightarrow$ Surveillance with upper endoscopy is critical
:::

## Radiofrequency ablation for Dysplasia

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Dysplasia can be treated with destroying the mucosa, the inner layer of esophgus

Ablation of the mucosa with microwave energy

Because the risk of spread to the lymph nodes is very low, there tumors can often be removed with endoscopy without the need for surgery.

## Treatment Plan

::::::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
::: fragment
Superficial (T1)

-   Endoscopic Therapy
:::

::: fragment
Localized (T1b/T2)

-   Surgery (esophagectomy)
:::

::: fragment
Locally-advanced (T3M0)

-   Chemo$\pm$Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery
:::

::: fragment
Metastatic (M1)

-   Chemotherapy
:::
:::::::

::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 or N1 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Superficial Cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Superficial Cancer: T1a N0

Treatment is often with endoscopy without the need for surgery.

Becauase the risk of spread to the lymph nodes is very low, there tumors can often be removed with endoscopy without the need for surgery.

## Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)

Endoscopic procedure to remove a superficial tumor from the inner layer of the esophagus
