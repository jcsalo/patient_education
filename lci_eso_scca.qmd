## Anatomy

Food moves from the throat

We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Treatment Plan

::::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

::: {.fragment}
Superficial (T1)

- Endoscopic Therapy
:::

::: {.fragment}
Localized (T1b)

- Surgery (esophagectomy)
:::

::: {.fragment}
Locally-advanced (T2M0 or T3M0)

- Chemo$\pm$Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery
:::

::: {.fragment}
Metastatic (M1)

- Chemotherapy
:::

:::::
::: {.content-hidden unless-format="docx"}
This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 and M0 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Locally-advanced cancers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer often have localized spread of cancer cells in the surrounding area

It is helpful to start with therapy *before* surgery that will shrink the cancer.

## Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously.

There are several options for intravenous access:

-   Peripheral IVs in the hand
-   PICC line (Peripheral Inserted Central Catheter)
-   Central Venous Port

[Central Venous Port](lci_cvport.htm)

## Restaging

CT or PET scan will be performed after preoperative therapy

\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy

## Restaging Endoscopy after Chemo + Radiation

Endoscopy is performed to look for signs of persistent cancer

Biopsies are negative in approximately 75% of cases

Complete disappearance of cancer is only found in 40% of cases

$\Rightarrow$ cancer cells can hide in the wall of the esophagus

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Surgery is recommended for all patients who have:

-   Biopsies showing cancer after chemo + radiation
-   No signs of spread of disease on PET/CT scan
-   Healthy enough to undergo surgery

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Surgery is also recommended for patients who:

-   No signs of spread on disease on PET/CT scan
-   Cancer in the lower part of the esophagus
-   Healthy enough to undergo surgery

## Surveillance if Surgery Not Performed

-   Upper endoscopy (EGD) every 3-6 months
-   PET every 6 months

$\Rightarrow$ Surgery if a recurrence in the esophagus is found
