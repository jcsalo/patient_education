## Anatomy

Food moves from the throat

$\rightarrow$ esophagus

$\rightarrow$ stomach

$\rightarrow$ small bowel (jejunum)

We'll start with reviewing some anatomy about how the body digests food.

Food moves from the throat to the esophagus, and from there to the stomach.

From the stomach, food moved through a valve called the pylorus into the small intestines

## Treatment Plan Depends upon Stage

::::::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
::: fragment
Superficial (T1): Endoscopic Therapy
:::

::: fragment
Localized (T1b): Surgery (esophagectomy)
:::

::: fragment
Locally-advanced (T2/3): Chemo+Radiation $\rightarrow$Surgery
:::

::: fragment
Metastatic (M1): Chemotherapy
:::

This table summarizes four different treatment categories:

-   Superficial cancers are T1 and can be treated by endoscopic therapy without the need for surgery
-   Localized cancers are T1b or T2 and are frequently treated by surgery alone without the need for chemotherapy or radiation
-   Locally-advanced cancers are T3 and M0 and are usually treated with some combination of chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery
-   Metastatic cancers are M1 and are treated primary by chemotherapy.

## Restaging

CT or PET scan performed after initial therapy

\

-   Surgery performed after restaging
-   Timing depends upon recovery from therapy

## Endoscopy after Initial Therapy

Performed to look for signs of persistent cancer

Biopsies show no cancer in 75% of cases

Disappearance of cancer in 40% of cases
- Persistent cancer in 60%

$\Rightarrow$ cancer cells can hide in the wall of the esophagus

Regular endoscopy is important to look for regrowth of cancer

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Surgery is recommended for all patients who have:

-   Biopsies showing cancer after chemo + radiation
-   No signs of spread of disease on PET/CT scan
-   Healthy enough to undergo surgery

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Surgery is also recommended for patients who:

-   No signs of spread on disease on PET/CT scan
-   Cancer in the lower part of the esophagus
-   Healthy enough to undergo surgery

## Surveillance if Surgery Not Performed

-   Upper endoscopy (EGD) every 3-6 months
-   PET every 6 months

$\Rightarrow$ Surgery if a recurrence in the esophagus is found
